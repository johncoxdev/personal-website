Welcome to my website!

## Creation
The creation of this website took a long time, as I took many inspirations from many different people. Ulimately I wanted to create a space themed website that showcased my software development projects. I used Figma as my source of creating multiple designs for my website. Design 3 will ultimately be the deisgn I will go with, as I will continue to make changes to Design 3 as the way I love. But the main theme will be the same. You can check out my figma document [here](https://www.figma.com/file/udvwIWSfmnBeW8qu1gCugh/Website-Layouts?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=dvj1Gl74b2Ua9HaH-1)
